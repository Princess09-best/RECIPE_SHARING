              <p>
               
                To a casual observer, jollof rice may look like a simple bowl of rice stained red by tomatoes, but there's more to this popular dish than meets the eye. Enormously popular across West Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana all claim it as one of their national dishes.

                A love for fried dough seems to be nearly universal in the world's food traditions, and Ghana is no exception. A popular street food worth looking for (it won't be hard to find) is bofrot — small, round, fried yeasted doughnuts.  While they're often eaten as snacks (sometimes with peanuts),  some aficionados feel they're best for breakfast eaten straight from the fryer alongside a bowl of koko.

              <h4><b>Koko and koose</b></h4> 
              <p>AThick, hearty porridges are common choices. Among these, the fermented corn porridge koko is especially esteemed. Made from cornmeal and water (and sometimes, sweet, warm spices such as ginger and pepper) that are mixed together and allowed to ferment before cooking, the porridge has a distinctively tangy flavor from the fermentation, which eaters can complement (or tame) with the optional addition of sugar and/or evaporated milk. </p>

                Peanuts and other groundnuts (such as tiger nuts) have long been staples in African cooking and are used in many cuisines across the continent. In Ghana, peanuts are not only enjoyed as snacks, but are common ingredients in breakfast dishes such as porridges, soups, and stews, where they provide body as well as flavor.

              <p>Okra is native to West Africa, and African cooks were the first to make use of it, making the slender green pods the star ingredient in a number of favorite dishes. Indeed, the word okra itself has African roots and comes from the Igbo word for the vegetable, "ókùrù.
